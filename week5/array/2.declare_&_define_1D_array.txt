Syntax:

    data_type nameofthearray[number of elements];

declaration:
                          +---+---+---+---+---+
    int arr[5]; ----> arr |   |   |   |   |   |
                          +---+---+---+---+---+

    Compiler will allocate a contiguous block of memory of size = 5 *sizeof(int) ---> value of int depends on processor


- Length of an array can be specified by any Positive integer constant expression:

1. int arr[5];

2. int arr[5+5];

3. int arr[5*3];

4. int arr[5*3];

5. int arr[-5]; ----> X Can't be -ve 

6. int a;
   int arr[a =21/3];


***NOTE:
        Specify the length of an array using macro is considered to be an excellent practice.


        #define N 10

        int arr[N]; ----> as when we have to change the value of N used in the whole of the code, then we don't have to change 
                        all the variable value to new value, We have to simply 
                        
                        change value of N in macro only
