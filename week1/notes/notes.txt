Getting Started:

    Overview:

        C language is near to to bare metal, near to the computer hardware and gives us the level of understanding
        The term "bare metal" refers to a hard disk, the usual medium on which a computer's OS is installed.

    History of C:

        Invented by Dennis Ritchie

First Program:

    Compiling, debugging, and running a program, part1:

        Tools needed: Compiler --> gnu Compiler(gcc), notepad(windows), visual studios
                      Editors ---> vi, vim, notepad

        Steps:

            1. Compile
                - Syntax Error     
              
            2. Fix Error & Recompile:
                - Run               
                - Wrong Answer -----> Again to 1.
                
                - If correct -----> get an ouput compiled File(A Run time Executable Code/ Machine Code) with extension a.out(assembler output) by default.

                  There is a Problem with a.out file

                  So, we use:
                            gcc -o file.exe file.c  [Attouching .exe as extension will make a file automatically Executable]

                            

        NOTE:
            Professor Ira Pohl(Instructor) suggested to write code in paper before typing in System

    
    
        Compiling, debugging, and running a program, part2(File included +):


            see:  samplePrgrm/

            1. gcc -o prgm.exe prgrm1.c

    
        First Program:

            see: prgm1/

        Circle code:

            see: Circlecode/

            #include <stdio.h>
            |
            |---> The header file stdio.h stands for Standard Input Output. It has the information related to input/output functions.
            |see:  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/header-files-stdio-h-and-stdlib-h-in-c
            |
            |---> This type of preprocessor directive tells the compiler to include a file in the source code program.
