Week 1:

    Getting Started:

        Overview:

            C language is near to to bare metal, near to the computer hardware and gives us the level of understanding
            The term "bare metal" refers to a hard disk, the usual medium on which a computer's OS is installed.

        History of C:

            Invented by Dennis Ritchie

    First Program:

        Compiling, debugging, and running a program, part1:

            Tools needed: Compiler --> gnu Compiler(gcc), notepad(windows), visual studios
                        Editors ---> vi, vim, notepad

            Steps:

                1. Compile
                    - Syntax Error     
                
                2. Fix Error & Recompile:
                    - Run               
                    - Wrong Answer -----> Again to 1.
                    
                    - If correct -----> get an ouput compiled File(A Run time Executable Code/ Machine Code) with extension a.out(assembler output) by default.

                    There is a Problem with a.out file

                    So, we use:
                                gcc -o file.exe file.c  [Attouching .exe as extension will make a file automatically Executable]

                                

            NOTE:
                Professor Ira Pohl(Instructor) suggested to write code in paper before typing in System

        
        
            Compiling, debugging, and running a program, part2(File included +):


                see:  samplePrgrm/

                1. gcc -o prgm.exe prgrm1.c

        
            First Program:

                see: prgm1/

            Circle code:

                see: Circlecode/

                #include <stdio.h>
                |
                |---> The header file stdio.h stands for Standard Input Output. It has the information related to input/output functions.
                |see:  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/header-files-stdio-h-and-stdlib-h-in-c
                |
                |---> This type of preprocessor directive tells the compiler to include a file in the source code program.

            Marathon:

                see: marathon/


        Simple input/output:

            Simple input/output - fahrenheit

                see: Temp_unit_chnge/

            
            Simple input/output - miles

                see: dist_unit_chnge/


Week 2:

    Character sets and tokens:

        Tokens are the smallest elements of a program, which are meaningful to the compiler.
        The following are the types of tokens: Keywords, Identifiers, Constant, Strings, Operators, etc.

        1. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tokens-in-c

        2. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-detect-tokens-c-program/

        During compilation,
            Compiler looks for syntax errors 1st

            If it gets error , We have to fix it
            
            Else
            
            It it will it symantically analyse the code whether it has error or notepad

            Then program is Run......
